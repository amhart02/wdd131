        <h2>Mosiah 2:41</h2>
        <p>
          "And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed
          and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For
          behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual;
          and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into
          heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of
          never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are
          true; for the Lord God hath spoken it."

          both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all
          power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not
          comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend."
